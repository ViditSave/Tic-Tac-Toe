# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game, X and O, who take turns marking their signs on a 3Ã—3 grid. The first player to place three of his/her marks in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line wins the game. The project uses the Tkinter Module, which is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Tkinter is an excellent choice to develop small and quick GUI applications.
